# How tokenizing a fund will be useful

* __Liquidity__ Tokens allow retail investors to easily cash in and
  cash out of shares, and will allow institutional investors to more
  easily do portfolio rebalancing and liquidity management.

* __Expanded customer base__ A tokenized fund will also allow
  investors to easily convert shares to non-standard currencies or
  cryptocurrencies.

* __Custody/Compliance__ Holding registered, non-negotiable tokens
  will allow both retail and institutional investors to have
  cryptocurrency exposure with lower cybersecurity risks, and the fund
  structure funds into existing compliance structures.

* __Marketing__ Right now there is a great deal of hype around STO's
  no no good offerings.  Being able to say "we've done it" allows
  access to conferences which gets access to potential clients with
  interest in new technologies.

#  Possible new clients for a hedge fund are:
  
* institutions.  Going through cryptoconferences gets you connected
  with institutional people that work out of "digitial strategies" or
  "innovation groups".  This people are more likely to be receptive to
  funds that are doing new things.

* mass affluent individuals.  I want to be able to sell CryptAm shares
  to my ex-coworkers at JPM, and a tokenized fund structure is a
  compliance and custody solution

* family offices.  There are people going to these conferences and not
  seeing anything they can buy

* emerging markets.  Start with Mainland China, then India, then
  Middle East and Africa.  Tokenization and cryptocurrencies allows
  users in remote markets to invest into cryptofund using local
  currencies mediated by cryptocurrencies

# What is needed from client hedge fund

* __Strategic direction__ There are many things that can be done with
  security tokens, but it is necessary to have a specific client with
  specific needs to focus the actual use of the security token

* __System integration__ A specific client is needed to integrate the
  reporting systems and operational mechanisms with the client hedge
  fund.

* __Legal review__ Will need access to legal counsel to review draft
  of the tokenization documents.

# Scenarios

__Family office__ We meet people in family office X or investment bank
  Y at a conference on security tokens.  The family office is
  interested in security tokens, but they have a number of issues.  We
  sign them on a traditional fund using cryptocurrencies, and provide
  a transition plan to allow them to migrate their systems to use
  cryptotokens.

* __HNWI__ I introduce the tokens to my friends in the investment
  bank.  Because it's an ordinary hedge fund, the friend can get
  compliance clearance to invest, but because they are tokens, they
  can put the shares on their cell phone.  Because everything is on
  the blockchain, they can provide bank compliance with holding
  information directly from blockchain.

* __Mainland retail investors__ We get investors in Mainland China by
  doing small road shows there.  The investor funds the fund by
  converting RMB to cryptocurrencies and sending over the tokens.
  They can then monitor their investments through their cell phone,
  and can sell those tokens to other Mainland Chinese investors via
  P2P sale and bank transfer
