# Risk questionaire

The purpose of this questionaire is to determine investor suitablity
for high risk, dangerous security products.  For most consumer
products, various governments have created many safety mechanisms to
insure that purchasers of the products are not cheated out of their
money.

However, the consumer protections limit the products which can be
offerred to consumers.  There are another set of products which are
available to professional investors, who are willing to do their own
research, and are able to accept the consequences of high risk
protects.

This questionaire is designed to check for investor suitability.
