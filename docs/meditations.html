<h2>Meditations on securities law</h2>

<section>
<h2>What lawyers do</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Lawyers keep you out of trouble</li>
  <li>They check for compliance against the law</li>
  <li>They help you work through parts of the law that are
  complicated or counterinitutive</li>
  <li>They are messengers of the state (don't do this or bad things
  will happen)</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>The lawyer view of the world</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Very risk averse</li>
  <li>Very local based</li>
  <li>Mostly pulled into bad situations.  i.e. your average divorce
  lawyer isn't involved with happy marriages</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Limits with the lawyer view of the world</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The lawyer usually tells you what you can't do</li>
  <li>The lawyer can't tell you about other jurisdictions</li>
  <li>The lawyer tells you what the law is, not what it should be and
    often not what it will be</li>
  <li>Sometimes the answer is "I don't know"</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Investment banker and theoretical physicist views of the world</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Investment bankers make deals.  Deals are usually based on human
  emotion.  Namely fear and greed.  Emotions are universal across
  human beings, and also you are dealing with someone that wants to deal.</li>
  <li>Theoretical physicist hat.  Look for universals.  Figure out
  theories of behavior</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Thought experiment</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I go into a store in France.  I take a candy bar.  I pay.
    Everything works ok.</li>
  <li>I go into a store in France.  I take a candy bar.  I then take
  off my pants and punch the store owner in the face.</li>
  <li>I think I will get into trouble.  How do I know that I've done
  something bad even though I know nothing about the French legal code.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Law is like food</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Different places have different ways of approach law and
  finance just like different places have different foods</li>
  <li>There are some universals.  Arsenic in food is bad.  Don't
  leave meat out or it will spoil.</li>
  <li>But different places have different approaches to money.</li>
</ul>
</section>


<section>
  <h2>Why are securities special?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I buy a candy bar.  I give money.  The person at the other end
  gives me a candy bar.  If they just take my money and don't give me
  a candy bar, I know something went wrong.</li>
  <li>I buy a security.  I hand the seller money, and he shakes my
  hand, gives me some papers, and walks away.  How do I know that he
    didn't just steal my money?</li>
  <ul>
    <li>It gets worse. It's *easier* for someone to take the money
      and run, than to actually do something real.  You make *more*
      money if you take the money and run.</li>
    <li>Also suppose you catch the guy and toss them in jail.  I'm
    still out of my money.  I don't care if the guy is in jail.  I'm
      still lost my money.</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>What's wrong with securities laws?</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Securities laws are based on access control by national
  governments.  We make sure that you can't get exposed to bad stuff.</li>
  <li>This will not work with the internet unless you want to close
    your borders</li>
  <li>Securities laws fix some problems but lead to others.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>The analogy with food</h2>
<ul>
  <li>If you go to a fast food restaurant in the US, you are very
  unlikely to get sick because of food poisoning.  Health and safety
  insures that.  However, if you eat the US diet, you are likely to
    die from heart disease or diabetes.</li>
  <li>By contrast if you go to somewhere with weak health inspections,
  you find ways of avoiding getting sick, and often the diet is
  healthier.</li>
